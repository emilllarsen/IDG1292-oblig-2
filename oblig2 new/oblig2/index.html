              World Mental Health Day is coming up on October 10! It’s a day
              celebrated in over 150 countries to spread awareness about mental
              health. In Norway, we kick off a national public health campaign
              that runs from weeks 39 to 42 each year. During this time,
              schools, workplaces, and organizations come together to promote
              understanding and openness about mental health.

              This year, the World Health Organization (WHO) is teaming up with
              partners to highlight the important link between mental health and
              work. Safe and healthy work environments can protect our mental
              well-being. On the flip side, unhealthy conditions—like stigma,
              discrimination, and harassment—can really take a toll on our
              mental health and overall quality of life. With 60% of people
              around the world in jobs, it’s crucial that we take action to
              create workplaces that support mental health.

              To improve mental health at work, everyone needs to work together—
              governments, employers, worker organizations, and others. It's
              important to include the voices of workers and those who have
              experienced mental health issues. By focusing on proven strategies
              and interventions, we can help create environments where everyone
              can thrive at work and in life.

          <h2>Key Messages</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="page">
          <p>
            Mental Health and Work: Mental health is closely tied to work. A
            supportive workplace promotes mental well-being, while poor
            conditions can harm it, leading to lower job satisfaction and
            productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Risks to Workers: Workers face various mental health risks, such as
            discrimination and inadequate working conditions. Low-paid or
            insecure jobs often leave workers more vulnerable to these risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Impact on Individuals: Insufficient support for those with mental
            health conditions can harm their confidence, job satisfaction, and
            ability to work. Family members and caregivers are also affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wider Societal Impact: Poor mental health results in decreased
            performance and higher absenteeism. Depression and anxiety alone
            cause about 12 billion workdays lost each year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stigma and Employment: Stigma and discrimination can prevent
            individuals with mental health conditions from seeking help or
            maintaining employment. Reducing discrimination through awareness
            and training can create healthier work environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supporting Workers: Employers should make reasonable accommodations
            for workers with mental health conditions, such as regular check-ins
            and flexible schedules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manager Training: Employers should train managers to recognize
            stressors and support their teams effectively, fostering a healthier
            workplace
          </p>
          <p>
            Government Collaboration: Governments, employers, and worker
            organizations must collaborate to create policies that promote
            well-being and prioritize mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-Care: While it’s essential for employers and governments to
            promote mental health, individuals can also take steps to care for
            their own well-being. Learn stress management techniques and seek
            support from trusted sources when needed.
